Lucas did not propose a detailed program to implement his policy agenda, nor was he actively promoting his policy agenda.

Our findings indicate that modifications made to the CBI's linkages during the secular stagnation era shaped the ECB's framing of the new inflation era in a novel way. However, despite acknowledging difficult policy tradeoffs, which they used to downplay in the past, ECB policymakers have continued to reframe its initial imperative of responsibility in the hope of avoiding policy discussions on regime change.},

  abstract = {We propose a history of the evolution of the relationship between economists, economic knowledge, and central banks since the 1920s. Central banks have become pivotal in economic management, focusing on tasks such as promoting price stability, curbing unemployment, and managing financial crises. Central banks operate independently to insulate monetary policy from political debates, and their autonomy is justified by their expertise. The text explores the close ties between central banks and academia, highlighting the growing influence of economists within central banks and their role in shaping economic policies. Our contribution is divided into four parts. The first part introduces fundamental concepts related to the use of economic expertise and the "scientization" of central banks. It explores various research frameworks to understand the influence of economists within central banks. The second part covers the period from 1920 to 1970 when economists within central banks faced competition from experts with banking and financial backgrounds. Economists gained prominence through the hiring of renowned academic figures, and economic divisions were established for data collection and forecasting, setting the stage for their future significance. The third part discusses debates from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, marked by the stagflation of the 1970s. Economists criticized central bank policies, leading to increased scrutiny. Central banks adopted inflation targeting, transforming into independent institutions primarily focused on monetary policy. New concepts emerged through collaboration between central bankers and academic macroeconomists. The fourth part explores the "scientization" of central banks post-1990s. Central banks became leading producers of economic knowledge, with the rise of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. However, the 2007-2008 financial crisis raised questions about the relevance of these models, leading to a shift towards pluralist research programs and alternative perspectives. This shift poses new challenges for the role of economists within central banks, despite their firmly established centrality. The text provides a synthesis of existing research on this area and suggests avenues for future investigation.},

We argue that macroeconomists gathered by the ISoM contributed greatly to the making of a European network of economists sharing similar professional and intellectual standards. We illustrate how the ISoM stood at the crossroad of two types of "internationalisation" of economics: the integration of European national communities and the process of "Americanisation" of economics. While existing literature on "internationalization" focuses on the national level, our contribution investigates the European level. Moreover, we unveil how two research programmes in macroeconomics (namely the disequilibrium theory and large-scale macroeconometric modelling) played a significant role in this process.},

The act committed the federal government to reducing unemployment to 4 percent and inflation to 3 percent as soon as 1983. Initially, the Humphrey-Hawkins bill was conceived as a project to favor the economic integration of African Americans and economic planning and targeted only the unemployment rate. Republican senators successfully pushed for adding a numerical inflation target during the debates in Congress. The act eventually put on equal footing inflation and unemployment. This article argues that the economists in the Carter administration, and notably the Council of Economic Advisers, were instrumental, even if unintentionally, in favoring the integration of an inflation target and such an interpretation of the bill. In the negotiations that opposed them to the supporters of the bill, as well as in the analysis of the bill they produced, they insisted on the existence of a trade-off between inflation and unemployment and referred frequently to the famous Phillips curve. They endeavored to anchor their expertise on academic publications, which strengthened the role of the Phillips curve in shaping the debates. Business organizations and senators used references to the trade-off to undermine the bill and favor the integration of an inflation target.},

  abstract = {Economics in Europe has become more international since the 1970s. To a certain extent, this internationalisation is also an `Americanisation' as many European economists have adopted the standards and approaches of US economics. This prompts an important question: amidst this convergence, are there any fields that have managed to retain a distinctively European character? In this article, we use topic modelling and bibliometric coupling to identify European specialties between 1969 and 2002. We focus on macroeconomic articles published in the European Economic Review and compare their bibliographic references and textual content to what has been published in the top 5 journals. Despite economics internationalization since the 1970s, European macroeconomics displayed distinct characteristics across two distinct periods. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, European macroeconomists maintained a certain distance from US debates centred around rational expectations and new classical economics. However, they embraced the concept of microfoundations through the lens of disequilibrium theory, fostering transnational collaborations and offering a unique framework for addressing various macroeconomic issues. Nevertheless, both the prominence of new classical economics in the US and the decline of the disequilibrium approach after the mid-1980s, European macroeconomics shifted towards closer alignment with US approaches. In the 1990s, Political economy, inspired by pioneering US contributions like Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a,b), emerged in the 1990s as a new framework offering a common language for many European macroeconomists. However, specific European challenges like high unemployment rates and European integration continued to drive research in distinctive directions.},

To do so, we outline an ideal type of contributory scientization in central banks, whereby they become active contributors to science. The article derives empirically observable characteristics for this ideal type, regarding leadership and staff profiles, use of internal resources, composition of external networks, and publication and discursive outputs. The BoE is then contrasted to this ideal type of a central bank thoroughly involved in contributory scientization. The empirical material includes archives and interviews as well as three databases providing quantitative information from the 1970s to 2019. We find that the development of contributory scientization is strategically motivated, often generating tensions with policymaking and legitimizing dimensions. Our findings suggest that scientization in central banks is best understood as a three-dimensional, non-linear process, rather than a steamroller.},

Today, most contemporary macroeconomists and some historians of economics consider that Lucas's critique led forcefully to an immediate disqualification of the Keynesian macroeconometric approach. This narrative is based on the interpretation of the Lucas critique as a fundamental principle for economic reasoning that was (and still is) logically unquestionable. We consider that this narrative is problematic both in terms of historiography and the effects that it can have in the field as a way of assigning importance and credit to particular macroeconomists. Indeed, the point of view of the Keynesian economists is missing despite the fact that they were the target of Lucas's paper and that throughout the 1970s and 1980s they produced a fierce reaction against it. In this article we analyze the reactions by a broad set of authors (which we label ``Keynesians'') that disputed the relevance of the critique. In spite of their diversity in methodological, theoretical, and policy issues, these reactions were characterized by their common questioning of the empirical and practical relevance of the Lucas critique.},

It builds on the results of the contributions gathered in this special section on the scientization of central banking, to which this article also provides an introduction. We start with an analysis of Martin Marcussen's concept of `scientization', originally formulated to describe the changes within central banks since the 2000s. After highlighting how Marcussen's concept has raised different interpretations, we broaden our scope to examine how `scientization' is applied in the wider social sciences, extending beyond the study of central banks. This brings to the fore two ideas: scientization as `boundary work' (redrawing the line between `science' and `non-science') happening both in the public-facing (`frontstage') and internal (`backstage') activities of organizations. Finally, we suggest how these two ideas can be used to reinterpret `scientization' of central banks as the emergence of central banks as `boundary organizations'. This reframing allows us to untangle and clarify the phenomena previously conflated under the original concept of scientization, offering a more coherent framework for ongoing research on central banks.},

  abstract = {This article studies the dissemination of the Natural Rate of Unemployment Hypothesis (NRH) in macroeconomics during the 1970s, by studying the reaction of Robert J. Gordon to the argument of Friedman (1968). In the early 1970s, Gordon opposed the NRH, arguing that the estimated parameter on expected inflation was below one. Confronting to new data and to rising inflation, Gordon adopted the NRH after 1973. Nevertheless, the adoption anticipated any clear empirical proof. We explain that this conversion was due to Friedman's influence on Gordon, but also to the fact it did not prevent Gordon to support active stabilization policies.},

  abstract = {This article proposes a history of the evolution of macroeconomists' explanations of the 1970s US stagflation, from 1975 to 2013. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, 1) I observe the different types of explanations coexisting at different periods; 2) I assess which was the dominant type of explanations for each period; and 3) I identify the main sources of influence for the different types of explanations. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, supply-shocks and inflation inertia were fundamental concepts to explain stagflation. The interest for this topic progressively vanished after 1985. In the 1990s, it was a totally new literature that emerged almost without any reference to past explanations. This literature focused on the role played by monetary policy in the late 1960s and the 1970s to account for the rise of inflation. New Classical economists' contributions, like Lucas [1976] or Kydland and Prescott [1977], which were ignored by stagflation explanations in the 1970s/1980s, became major references to account for the 1970s stagflation in the 1990s.},

  abstract = {This article explores Robert E. Lucas's policy agenda and his engagement with the public debate between the 1970s and early 1980s. It investigates how he interacted with the public debate by envisioning key principles of his macroeconomic theory and methodology, and how he promoted his policy agenda. An exploration of Lucas's personal and professional archives sheds light on his participation in policy debates after the publication of his works, illustrating how Lucas built a discreet and cautious way of engaging with the public. Lucas did not propose a detailed program to implement his policy agenda, nor was he actively promoting his policy agenda. The article suggests that Lucas's originality compared to his contemporaries was his belief on the ability of macroeconomics to scientifically devise binding policy rules that could be integrated in an economic constitution.},
