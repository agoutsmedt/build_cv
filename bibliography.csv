We argue that macroeconomists gathered by the ISoM contributed greatly to the making of a European network of economists sharing similar professional and intellectual standards. We illustrate how the ISoM stood at the crossroad of two types of ""internationalisation"" of economics: the integration of European national communities and the process of ""Americanisation"" of economics. While existing literature on ""internationalization"" focuses on the national level, our contribution investigates the European level.

Today, most contemporary macroeconomists and some historians of economics consider that Lucas’s critique led forcefully to an immediate disqualification of the Keynesian macroeconometric approach. This narrative is based on the interpretation of the Lucas critique as a fundamental principle for economic reasoning that was (and still is) logically unquestionable. We consider that this narrative is problematic both in terms of historiography and the effects that it can have in the field as a way of assigning importance and credit to particular macroeconomists. Indeed, the point of view of the Keynesian economists is missing despite the fact that they were the target of Lucas’s paper and that throughout the 1970s and 1980s they produced a fierce reaction against it. In this article we analyze the reactions by a broad set of authors (which we label “Keynesians”) that disputed the relevance of the critique. In spite of their diversity in methodological, theoretical, and policy issues, these reactions were characterized by their common questioning of the empirical and practical relevance of the Lucas critique.","2019","2019-02-22 14:49:34","2024-03-23 15:41:17","","533-556","","3","51","","","Reacting to the Lucas Critique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://aurelien-goutsmedt.com/media/pdf/lucas-critique.pdf","","/home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/W8BUMM8H/Goutsmedt et al. - 2019 - Reacting to the Lucas Critique The Keynesians' Pr.pdf","","published; short-cv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using qualitative and quantitative methods, 1) I observe the different types of explanations coexisting at different periods; 2) I assess which was the dominant type of explanations for each period; and 3) I identify the main sources of influence for the different types of explanations. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, supply-shocks and inflation inertia were fundamental concepts to explain stagflation. The interest for this topic progressively vanished after 1985. In the 1990s, it was a totally new literature that emerged almost without any reference to past explanations. This literature focused on the role played by monetary policy in the late 1960s and the 1970s to account for the rise of inflation. New Classical economists’ contributions, like Lucas [1976] or Kydland and Prescott [1977], which were ignored by stagflation explanations in the 1970s/1980s, became major references to account for the 1970s stagflation in the 1990s.","2021","2021-01-26 13:31:23","2024-03-23 15:40:43","","557-582","","3","131","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://aurelien-goutsmedt.com/media/pdf/stagflation-great-inflation.pdf","","/home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/BBCH4ZLI/Goutsmedt - 2021 - From the Stagflation to the Great Inflation Expla.pdf","","published; short-cv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The act committed the federal government to reducing unemployment to 4 percent and inflation to 3 percent as soon as 1983. Initially, the Humphrey-Hawkins bill was conceived as a project to favor the economic integration of African Americans and economic planning and targeted only the unemployment rate. Republican senators successfully pushed for adding a numerical inflation target during the debates in Congress. The act eventually put on equal footing inflation and unemployment. This article argues that the economists in the Carter administration, and notably the Council of Economic Advisers, were instrumental, even if unintentionally, in favoring the integration of an inflation target and such an interpretation of the bill. In the negotiations that opposed them to the supporters of the bill, as well as in the analysis of the bill they produced, they insisted on the existence of a trade-off between inflation and unemployment and referred frequently to the famous Phillips curve. They endeavored to anchor their expertise on academic publications, which strengthened the role of the Phillips curve in shaping the debates. Business organizations and senators used references to the trade-off to undermine the bill and favor the integration of an inflation target.","2022","2021-02-23 15:12:14","2024-03-23 15:32:50","","619-653","","2","54","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://aurelien-goutsmedt.com/media/pdf/humphrey-hawkins.pdf","","/home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/AJBYYDMP/Goutsmedt - 2022 - How the Phillips Curve Shaped Full Employment Poli.pdf","","published; short-cv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Central banks have become pivotal in economic management, focusing on tasks such as promoting price stability, curbing unemployment, and managing financial crises. Central banks operate independently to insulate monetary policy from political debates, and their autonomy is justified by their expertise. The text explores the close ties between central banks and academia, highlighting the growing influence of economists within central banks and their role in shaping economic policies. Our contribution is divided into four parts. The first part introduces fundamental concepts related to the use of economic expertise and the ""scientization"" of central banks. It explores various research frameworks to understand the influence of economists within central banks. The second part covers the period from 1920 to 1970 when economists within central banks faced competition from experts with banking and financial backgrounds. Economists gained prominence through the hiring of renowned academic figures, and economic divisions were established for data collection and forecasting, setting the stage for their future significance. The third part discusses debates from the late 1970s to the mid-1990s, marked by the stagflation of the 1970s. Economists criticized central bank policies, leading to increased scrutiny. Central banks adopted inflation targeting, transforming into independent institutions primarily focused on monetary policy. New concepts emerged through collaboration between central bankers and academic macroeconomists. The fourth part explores the ""scientization"" of central banks post-1990s. Central banks became leading producers of economic knowledge, with the rise of Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models. However, the 2007-2008 financial crisis raised questions about the relevance of these models, leading to a shift towards pluralist research programs and alternative perspectives. This shift poses new challenges for the role of economists within central banks, despite their firmly established centrality. The text provides a synthesis of existing research on this area and suggests avenues for future investigation.","2025","2023-05-24 16:35:02","2025-10-29 14:44:37","","","","","Under contract, Forthcoming 2026","","","","","","","","Cambridge University Press, Cambridge Elements","Cambridge (UK)","","","","","","","","https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/acymv_v1","","","","long-cv; ongoing-pub","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To a certain extent, this internationalisation is also an ‘Americanisation’ as many European economists have adopted the standards and approaches of US economics. This prompts an important question: amidst this convergence, are there any fields that have managed to retain a distinctively European character? In this article, we use topic modelling and bibliometric coupling to identify European specialties between 1969 and 2002. We focus on macroeconomic articles published in the European Economic Review and compare their bibliographic references and textual content to what has been published in the top 5 journals. Despite economics internationalization since the 1970s, European macroeconomics displayed distinct characteristics across two distinct periods. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, European macroeconomists maintained a certain distance from US debates centred around rational expectations and new classical economics. However, they embraced the concept of microfoundations through the lens of disequilibrium theory, fostering transnational collaborations and offering a unique framework for addressing various macroeconomic issues. Nevertheless, both the prominence of new classical economics in the US and the decline of the disequilibrium approach after the mid-1980s, European macroeconomics shifted towards closer alignment with US approaches. In the 1990s, Political economy, inspired by pioneering US contributions like Kydland and Prescott (1977) and Barro and Gordon (1983a,b), emerged in the 1990s as a new framework offering a common language for many European macroeconomists. However, specific European challenges like high unemployment rates and European integration continued to drive research in distinctive directions.","2023","2022-09-27 20:03:17","2024-10-16 08:59:46","","104559","","","158","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://hal.science/hal-04181833","","/home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/CHH35DMH/Goutsmedt and Truc - 2023 - An Independent European Macroeconomics A History of European Macroeconomics through the Lens of the.pdf","","published; short-cv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This article investigates how the ECB has adjusted its logic of responsibility throughout this series of crises. Using a topic model and in-depth analysis of speeches, we examine the ECB’s strategic framing of linkages related to inflation during three historical periods: the Central Bank Independence (CBI) era (1998–2011), the secular stagnation era (2011–2021), and the new inflation era (2021-). Our findings indicate that modifications made to the CBI’s linkages during the secular stagnation era shaped the ECB’s framing of the new inflation era in a novel way. However, despite acknowledging difficult policy tradeoffs, which they used to downplay in the past, ECB policymakers have continued to reframe its initial imperative of responsibility in the hope of avoiding policy discussions on regime change.","2024","2022-08-02 14:58:42","2024-09-30 13:54:47","","999-1025","","4","31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","https://hal.science/hal-04181849","","/home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/BZ5HXN2Q/Goutsmedt_Fontan_2023_The ECB and the inflation monsters.pdf; /home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/W7YESMYJ/The ECB and the inflation monsters strategic framing and the responsibility imperative 1998 2023 .pdf","","published; short-cv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It builds on the results of the contributions gathered in this special section on the scientization of central banking, to which this article also provides an introduction. We start with an analysis of Martin Marcussen’s concept of ‘scientization’, originally formulated to describe the changes within central banks since the 2000s. After highlighting how Marcussen’s concept has raised different interpretations, we broaden our scope to examine how ‘scientization’ is applied in the wider social sciences, extending beyond the study of central banks. This brings to the fore two ideas: scientization as ‘boundary work’ (redrawing the line between ‘science’ and ‘non-science’) happening both in the public-facing (‘frontstage’) and internal (‘backstage’) activities of organizations. Finally, we suggest how these two ideas can be used to reinterpret ‘scientization’ of central banks as the emergence of central banks as ‘boundary organizations’. This reframing allows us to untangle and clarify the phenomena previously conflated under the original concept of scientization, offering a more coherent framework for ongoing research on central banks.","2025","2025-05-01 16:35:38","2025-10-29 15:21:29","2025-05-01 16:35:38","1-21","","","","","","Redefining Scientization","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","/home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/HTJ5EIWY/Goutsmedt and Sergi - 2025 - Redefining scientization Central banks between science and politics.pdf","","published; short-cv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Its main goal is to clarify the interactions and tensions among three dimensions of scientization: contributory, policymaking and legitimizing. To do so, we outline an ideal type of contributory scientization in central banks, whereby they become active contributors to science. The article derives empirically observable characteristics for this ideal type, regarding leadership and staff profiles, use of internal resources, composition of external networks, and publication and discursive outputs. The BoE is then contrasted to this ideal type of a central bank thoroughly involved in contributory scientization. The empirical material includes archives and interviews as well as three databases providing quantitative information from the 1970s to 2019. We find that the development of contributory scientization is strategically motivated, often generating tensions with policymaking and legitimizing dimensions. Our findings suggest that scientization in central banks is best understood as a three-dimensional, non-linear process, rather than a steamroller.","2025","2025-05-01 16:35:41","2025-10-29 15:21:09","2025-05-01 16:35:41","1-23","","","","","","Not a steamroller, a 3D process","","","","","","","en","","","","","Cambridge University Press","","","","/home/agoutsmedt/Zotero/storage/QZTWVIF2/Goutsmedt et al. - 2025 - Not a steamroller, a 3D process Scientization at the Bank of England.pdf","","published; short-cv","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It takes as a point of departure that economics has been characterized since the 1970s by an exponential increase in the number of articles published in academic journals. This phenomenon makes it harder for historians of economics to properly assess the trends in the transformation of economics, the main topics researched, the most influential authors and ideas, *etc*. As a result, historians of this period run the risk of relying, at least as first pass, on a presentist view of the history of ideas: what today’s economists consider as important contributions from the past and the most influential authors. When historians shield themselves from the retrospective views of the practising economists, they have to delve into the literature of the past that has been forgotten for the most part and to scrutinize the network of authors that are little known. This effort allows historians to correct the potted histories of the practising economists and to propose alternative narratives of the evolution of the discipline. However, the bigger the literature to be studied is, the harder the historians’ capacity to grasp the overall picture of the time. We agree with those who consider that developing collective quantitative tools could help historians to confront this challenge. The issues and uses of quantitative tools in history of economics have been the topic of many discussions in our field—see for instance Backhouse (1998), Claveau and Gingras (2016) and the Journal of Economic Methodology special issue in 2018, in particular Edwards, Giraud, and Schinckus (2018) and Cherrier and Svorenčík (2018)—, but the technical barrier posed by the methods remains an obstacle for many historians. The challenges and opportunities that a quantitative history brings are particularly useful to the recent history of macroeconomics. Practising macroeconomists are eager to tell narratives of the evolution of their field that serve the purpose of intervening on current debates, by giving credit to particular authors and weight to specific ideas. Historians who go into this area find plenty of accounts by macroeconomists and have to handle the vast increase in the macroeconomic literature since the last quarter of the past century. Our goal is to build an online interactive platform displaying bibliometric data on a large set of macroeconomic articles. We aim at settling the basis for a broad and long-run project on the history of macroeconomics, as well as to bring to historians tools to run quantitative inquiries to support their own research work.
